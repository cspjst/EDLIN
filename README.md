# EDLIN - A Historical Re-creation in C
My C99 implementation of the venerable PC/MS-DOS multi-modal, line-orientated, text editor - EDLIN.

## Synopsis
EDLIN was developed in 1980 by Tim Paterson for Seattle Computer Products' QDOS 0.1. When Paterson sold the operating system to Microsoft, EDLIN was included as a temporary solution—intended to last about six months. By virtue of its sheer utility, it persisted as the standard text editor until MS-DOS 4.01, surviving for nearly 11 years until the release of MS-DOS 5.0. During that time, despite various language localizations, it was never significantly updated or overhauled.

## Why recreate EDLIN?
When I first decided to implement my own version of EDLIN, I presumed I was taking on a simple programming exercise—a chance to cut my teeth on tokenizing and parsing techniques with what I assumed would be a straightforward DOS relic. How wrong I was.

What began as a parsing challenge quickly transformed into a journey through computing history and a masterclass in elegant software design. EDLIN, Microsoft's first text editor from 1981, revealed itself to be anything but simple. Beneath its minimalist interface lay a remarkably sophisticated tool built with astonishing efficiency, shaped by the computing constraints of its era.

## The Frenzy of the First MS-DOS
The story of "Big Blue" agreeing with a scrappy young company called Microsoft to produce an operating system for its new computer, the IBM PC—before Bill Gates even had a finished product—has taken its place in computing legend. Part of that legend is EDLIN.

EDLIN had to operate within brutal constraints: 64KB of memory, 4.77MHz processors, and no modern parsing libraries. Yet it managed to deliver a powerful mulit-modal, line-editing experience with context-aware parsing, relative addressing, and a complex command syntax that would challenge any developer to implement cleanly.

Running the 86-DOS emulator on an IBM PC with DOS 3.1 as a reference, I began using EDLIN firsthand. The programming challenges emerged quickly. I dug into EDLIN's command structure—the mix of `[parameters]COMMAND` and `COMMAND[parameters]` patterns, the elegant handling of optional arguments, and the clever use of context that made it so much more than a simple editor. This wasn't just a primitive tool; it was a beautifully designed system that enabled efficient text manipulation through a concise, expressive mini-language.

## EDLIN Functionality: A Multi-Modal Editing Experience
Delving into EDLIN reveals its powerful command syntax. This wasn't a system built on a single, rigid grammar rule. Instead, it employed several distinct syntactic patterns, each elegantly matched to the prevailing use-case and task at hand — writing and editing computer programs. The command syntax enables the editor to shift between distinct modes: command input, mini-editor, text insertion, and interactive search/replace-each optimized for a specific editing task. This multi-modal design is the key to its power and efficiency.

### 1. Command Mode: The Primary Interface
Upon startup, EDLIN awaits commands. This mode follows a sophisticated yet intuitive syntax for manipulating text.

+ Simple Commands: Single-character commands execute immediately, such as:

  + `E` (End Edit & Save)

  + `Q` (Quit without Saving)

  + `?` (Help)

+ "Select, Then Act" Commands: The core editing logic uses a `[range]COMMAND`pattern. This natural flow involves specifying a line number range first, then the action to perform on it.

  + `10,20L` lists lines 10 through 20.

  + `,20D` deletes from the current line (a convenient default) to line 20.

+ Hybrid Search/Replace Commands: For commands requiring additional input, the grammar expands to [range][?]COMMAND[text]. The parser's sophistication allows for flexible combinations:

  + `Stex`t performs a raw search from the current line.

  + `1,100?Rold,new` performs an interactive replace (?) across a defined range, replacing old with new.

### 2. Insert Mode: Adding New Text
Commands like `I` (Insert) and their hybrid pattern, `[line]I`, act as a bridge. They accept a single starting line number before transitioning the editor from Command Mode into Insert Mode. In this state, the user enters text line-by-line. Exiting is done by entering a single period . on an empty line and pressing Enter (a convention adopted from FreeDOS, replacing the original Ctrl-C).

### 3. Line Edit Mode: The Single-Line Mini-Editor
The most fascinating modal shift occurs when you enter a line number alone (e.g., 15). This enters _Line Edit Mode_, a powerful single-line editor controlled by function and control keys.

+ The current line's text is displayed and becomes the _template_.

+ Function Keys (F1-F4) are used to copy characters from the template onto the new line.

+ The Insert (Ins) key toggles between overwriting and inserting characters into the new line.

+ The Escape (Esc) key cancels all edits, restoring the original line.

+ Pressing Enter finalizes the edits, incorporating any changes made using the function keys and insert mode.

### 4. Memory Management Commands: A Testament to Hardware Constraints
Some commands reveal the brutal memory limitations of the early 1980s. The A (Append) command is a prime example. It was not for adding typed content, but for loading the next segment of a file from disk into RAM. When a file was too large for the 64KB memory limit, EDLIN would only load a portion. `[#lines]A` was a memory management tool, appending the next block of the file from disk to make it editable.

## Implementation notes

For this implementation of EDLIN the _command mode_ usage is slightly different, such that, the user does not have to type the control characters mandated by the original Microsoft DOS version of EDLIN:
+ To exit from _insert mode_ rather than typing `Ctrl-C` (in the same way as the FreeDOSS version of EDLIN) the user enters a single fullstop (aka period) on an empty line and hits `Enter` - this will switch to _command mode_.
+ Using the (R)eplace command, rather than separating the search and replace text strings with `Ctrl-Z` a simple comma between them will suffice e.g. `?Rold,new`
+ Multiple commands on one line is valid in EDLIN but rather than permitting one command to follow another without any special separators - other than a semicolon `;` after single line number or range - my version insists on semicolon separator between all commands on a single line.
+ When in template mode rather using `INS` to switch into inser mode and `INS F3` to switch back my EDLIN uses `INS` to toggle modes.
