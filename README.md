EDLIN was developed in 1980 by Tim Paterson for Seattle Computer Products (QDOS 0.2) before Paterson sold the operating system to Microsoft. There it was only intended as a temporary solution for about half a year. It is a derivative of the line-oriented editor ED.COM from CP/M-80. However, it was included as the only standard text editor until MS-DOS 4.01 (and thus for almost 11 years until the release of MS-DOS 5.0). During this time, apart from various language versions, it was apparently never significantly changed or further developed.
